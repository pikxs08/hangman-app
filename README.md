# **How to Play Hangman**

# **Objective:**
Guess the hidden word by entering letters. Each correct guess reveals letters in the word, while each incorrect guess adds a part to the hangman figure. You have 10 tries to guess the word correctly before the hangman is fully drawn.

# **Game Rules:**
Guess the Word: Enter letters into the input field to guess the hidden word. The word is randomly chosen from a predefined list.

Letter Input: Type a letter and press Enter or click the "Guess" button to submit your guess. Only letters from A to Z are valid inputs.

Correct Guesses: If your guessed letter is in the hidden word, it will be revealed in its correct position(s).

Incorrect Guesses: If your guessed letter is not in the hidden word, a part of the hangman figure will be drawn. You have 10 incorrect guesses before the game ends.

Winning: If you correctly guess all the letters in the word before making 10 incorrect guesses, you win the game.

Losing: If you make 10 incorrect guesses before guessing the word correctly, the hangman figure will be fully drawn, and you lose the game.

Play Again:
If you want to play again, simply click the "Play Again" button. This will reset the game, allowing you to start a new round with a new word.

Tips:
Start with common vowels (e.g., A, E, I, O, U) as they are often present in words.
Pay attention to the revealed letters and try to guess the word based on the visible pattern.
Have Fun and Good Luck!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
